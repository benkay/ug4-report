\chapter{Evaluation}

An important stage in developing a user interface (especially one which is designed to improve usability) is to evaluate the system with user testing. There are three reasons for performing this task: to check whether the software actually helped the users, by how much the users were helped and also to see how the software could be changed in order to improve its usability.
