\chapter{Prior Work}

There is prior work into improving database usability\cite{Date, Jagadish2007} but these only discuss the current problems with the database management systems and mention possibilities about how they could be improved without actually creating any of the systems. It does however offer up interesting ideas such as integrating database management systems with other graphics and word processing packages. My project will be closely related to these papers with respect to some of the data representation features. 

There has been other work into improving the usability and understanding of database queries\cite{Hu2008,Haritsa2010,Yang2010,Jin2010}. While my project isn't going in this direction it is interesting to see different approaches to the database usability problem. In this case the technologies developed help more technical users break down queries and streams to see patterns and opportunities for optimisation.

There has also been work done into finding accessible and usable ways to represent data that is inside the database\cite{Stolte2010,Chan2009}. This is again in a different direction to my project as it usually focuses on read-only representations of the data rather than a new way of improving usability for all uses of the database including modifying and entering data.
