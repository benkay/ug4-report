	I'd first like to thank my supervisor, Stratis Viglas, for keeping me on
	track and offering fantastic feedback throughout the year.

	I'd also like to thank Ewan Klein and the rest of my project group for
	offering a tenth pair of eyes on the progress of my project at our
	meetings.

	Finally I'd like to thank the numerous creators and maintainers of the
	\LaTeX\ \texttt{infthesis} class who stopped me procrastinating by doing
	much of the typesetting work beforehand.
