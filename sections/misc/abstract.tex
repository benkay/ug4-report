\abstract{We directly and indirectly interact with thousands of databases per day. However, despite this widespread usage they are often hidden at the bottom of the software infrastructure and require bespoke solutions in order to allow users to interact with them.

One of the problems is that to interact with databases often requires domain knowledge of the database structure or query languages. There is a need for solutions that allow regular users to interact with databases. This project aims to be one such solution to the problem.}
