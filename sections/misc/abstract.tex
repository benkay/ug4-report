Usability testing is one of the most important aspects of modern application
development. This is especially true in the competitive mobile landscape,
where user interface conventions are in their infancy and constantly evolving.
Despite this, it is one of the hardest aspects of testing to get right. It
can also be the most expensive, providing a high barrier to entry for small
developers. This project aims to be one solution to this problem, giving
a way for creators to test their apps quickly and cheaply with users.
