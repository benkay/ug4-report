We directly and indirectly interact with thousands of databases per day. However, despite this widespread usage they are often hidden at the bottom of the software infrastructure and require bespoke solutions to enable users to interact with them.

\textsc{Sql} is a relatively unfriendly language that is useful for lower level use such as debugging a particular query or the study of databases. There is a need for tools that help all users easily interact with databases. This is the problem that I aim to solve in my project.
